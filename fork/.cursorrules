# NTQR Fork - Cursor Rules

# Workspace Boundaries
# -------------------
# All development work must remain strictly within the fork/ directory
# Do not modify any files outside the fork/ directory

# Directory Structure Rules
# ------------------------
# Maintain the following structure:
# - fork/src/ - For source code
# - fork/tests/ - For test cases
# - fork/docs/ - For documentation
#   - fork/docs/analytical/ - For analytical considerations
#   - fork/docs/operational/ - For operational guidelines

# Code Style and Quality
# ---------------------
# - Write professional, functional, intelligent code
# - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
# - Maintain proper documentation and comments
# - Follow modular design principles
# - Write tests for all new functionality
# - Ensure compatibility with the main NTQR package

# Integration with Main Package
# ---------------------------

# - Run tests against both the main package and our extensions
# - Document any differences in behavior from the main package

# Documentation
# ------------
# - Document analytical findings in docs/analytical/
# - Document operational considerations in docs/operational/
# - Include usage examples for all new functionality
# - Maintain a clear record of changes and improvements

# Experimental Features
# -------------------
# - Clearly mark experimental features as such
# - Isolate experimental code to prevent interference with stable code
# - Document the purpose and limitations of experimental features

# Version Control
# -------------
# - Use meaningful commit messages
# - Group related changes in single commits
# - Keep a clean commit history

# Security and Data
# ---------------
# - Do not commit sensitive data or credentials
